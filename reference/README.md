# Reference Scripts
These are a collection of scripts that may be of use when installing IBM CloudPak for AIOps

They are one automation of the steps provided in the respective documentation, provide hopefully "reasonable" defaults and some customizations.
They can be used in production enviroments but are no substitute for proper planning and understanding of the consequences.
In some cases, they might help clarify the docs.
It is expected they will be modified after reviewing to meet policies or constraints that the scripts have not considered.
Using these can help shorten the install time of AIOps especially in a proof of concept environment.
