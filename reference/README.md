# Reference Scripts
This collection of scripts can be used to assist with the installation of IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps. The scripts provide an automated approach for some ancillary options such as ODF storage and cluster logging, with reasonable default values and some customizations.

Use of these scripts might help to reduce the installation time of IBM Cloud Pak for AIOPs, especially in a proof of concept environment. The scripts can also be used in a production environment, but are not a substitute for thorough planning or an understanding of the installation process and its consequences. It is important to review and modify these scripts to ensure that they align with your organization's policies and constraints.
