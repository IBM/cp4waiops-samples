## Scope

The purpose of this project is to provide sample files and code snippets for IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps; for example, configuration yaml files, script sample files, and so on. You can directly download these files for either installing or configuring IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.

<!-- A more detailed Usage or detailed explaination of the repository here -->
## Usage

To understand and use the IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps, see the [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-waiops) and select the appropriate version.  

In the documentation, if the sample yaml file or script file is long, it is not included in the content. Instead, it is available inside this repo and linked to from the topic. By clicking the link in the topic, you open the specific file url and can then download the file to your local directory for direct use.

You can also refer to [cp4waiops-gitops](https://github.com/IBM/cp4waiops-gitops) repo to check how to use gitops to deploy the IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.
