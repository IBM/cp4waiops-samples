#### ***NOTE**: from CP4AIOps v4.1.0 onwards, the use of the status, status-all, status-upgrade functions are now considered **deprecated**. Please primarily refer to the installation status messages provided directly in the installation.orchestrator.aiops.ibm.com CR instance of your cluster's installation.*

# kubectl-waiops

A kubectl plugin for CP4AIOps

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/

## Highlights
Run `oc waiops multizone status` to view how well the installation is prepared for a zone outage.
Run `oc waiops multizone pods` to view which zone each pod is in.
  * **NOTE**: These functions require bash to be at least version **4**  (MacOS ships with a very old version)
  * **NOTE**: If you have installed/upgraded bash to a path other than `/bin/bash` change the first line of the script to that fully qualified path.

Run `oc waiops status` to print the statuses of some of your instance's main components. If you see components with issues (or are generally facing issues on your cluster), run `oc waiops status-all` for a more detailed printout with more components.

If you are upgrading your instance to the latest version, run `oc waiops status-upgrade`, which returns a list of components that have (and have not) completed upgrading. 

Below are example outputs of these commands.

## How to use

### Requirements
- You must have an installation of Cloud Pak for AIOps v3.x or v4.x on your cluster. 

**Note**: while this tool does not require you to be logged in as a cluster admin, however
 * `oc waiops multizone status` output may be limited and inaccurate without the required permissions
 * `oc waiops status-all`'s output will be limited if you are not. If possible, it is recommended to be logged in as a cluster admin to receive a more complete view of your install status.

### Dependencies
- `oc` cli

### Installing
Save `kubectl-plugin/kubectl-waiops` to a location in your path such as `/usr/local/bin/kubectl-waiops` and make the file executable. 

Verify plugin:
`oc plugin list`
> The output should include the location of the plugin such as /usr/local/bin/kubectl-waiops

### Quick start
```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/cp4waiops-samples.git
chmod +x cp4waiops-samples/kubectl-plugin/kubectl-waiops
cp cp4waiops-samples/kubectl-plugin/kubectl-waiops /usr/local/bin/kubectl-waiops

oc waiops multizone status
oc waiops status
oc waiops status-all
oc waiops status-upgrade
```
